## What is a URL?

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is used to specify its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is the fundamental network identification for any resource connected to the web (e.g., hypertext pages, images, and sound files).

URLs have the following format:

`protocol://hostname/other_information`

For example, the URL for w3resource's PHP basic exercises page is:

`'https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q1-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard';`
